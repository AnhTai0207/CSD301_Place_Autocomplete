PLACE AUTOCOMPLETE  
GROUP 2  
When you need to look up something on google do you ever have a question like “How google knows what am i looking for and suggest it for me when i do not even have the full sentence ?”. It’s actually a problem that has been solved long ago called “Place Autocomplete”, it will predict and suggest to you one or many results that start with your unfinished sentence so that you don’t need to type all the sentence, it helps you to save your time on your research.and it’s can also help when you don’t remember your search clearly.
